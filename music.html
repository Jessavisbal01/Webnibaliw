        <ul> 
         <center>    <h3>~Verse 1~</h3> You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.</li>

            <h3>~Chorus~</h3> If you could see that I'm the one
            Who understands you
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me</li>
          

           <h3>~Verse 2~</h3> Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
            I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
            Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
            Hey, isn't this easy?
         <mark>   And you've got a smile
            That can light up this whole town</mark>
            I haven't seen it in a while
            Since she brought you down
            You say you're fine, I know you better than that
            Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
            She wears high heels
            I wear sneakers
            She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
            Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
            That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.</li>         
          
            <h3>~chorus~</h3> If you could see that I'm the one
            Who understands you
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me </li>
        
            
            <h3>~Verse 3~</h3>Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
            All this time how could you not know, baby?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me
            Oh, I remember you driving to my house
            In the middle of the night
            I'm the one who makes you laugh
            When you know you're 'bout to cry
            And I know your favorite songs
            And you tell me 'bout your dreams
            Think I know where you belong
            Think I know it's with me</li>
          
            <h3>~Chorus~</h3> Can't you see that I'm the one
            Who understands you?
            Been here all along
            So, why can't you see?
            You belong with me
            Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
            All this time how could you not know, baby?
            You belong with me
            You belong with me </li>
           
            <h3>~Ending~</h3> You belong with me
            Have you ever thought just maybe
            You belong with me?
            You belong with me </li>
